## Practical 08

### Aim

Write a C program for selection sort. Generate equivalent 3-address code.

### Theory

Three address code is a form of intermediate code used in compiler design. Each instruction in three address code has three operands at most, along with an operator, and can be used to represent any statement. They are generally represented as A := B op C, where A, B and C are either programmer defined names, constants or compiler-generated temporary names and op is the operation applied on A and B. Three address codes are useful in determining the order of operations performed by the compiler, and are a crucial concept in compiler optimization.

Three address codes can be implemented using quadruples, triples and indirect triples. Quadruples break down each instruction into four parts: op, arg1, arg2 and result; triples do the same for three parts: op, arg1 and arg2; and indirect triples use a list of pointers to the triples to enhance the latter representation.

## Practical 09

### Aim 

Write a program to to optimize the three address code generated.

### Theory

Three Address Code (TAC) is a form of intermediate code used in compiler design. TAC aids in implementing code-improving transformations and is generated by the compiler for code optimization. Each instruction in TAC has three operands at most and an operator, and can be used to represent any statement. 

TAC can be implemented using quadruples, triples and indirect triples. Quadruples break down each instruction into four parts, triples into three parts and indirect triples use a list of pointers to triples.

Some optimization techniques that can be applied to TAC include:

1. **Arithmetic Identities**: This optimization technique rewrites arithmetic expressions using identities, such as distributive or commutative properties, to simplify the code.

2. **Reduce in strength**: This technique simplifies complex arithmetic or logical expressions by reducing them to simpler, equivalent expressions, such as replacing a multiplication by a constant with repeated additions.

3. **Constant propagation**: This optimization technique replaces variables with their constant values when it is safe to do so, allowing for the elimination of unnecessary computations.

4. **Copy propagation**: This technique replaces a variable with another variable that has the same value, allowing for the elimination of unnecessary computations.

5. **Remove temporaries**: This optimization technique eliminates unnecessary variables, reducing memory usage and potentially allowing for further optimizations.

6. **Remove needless jumps**: This technique eliminates jumps that do not affect the control flow, simplifying the code and potentially allowing for further optimizations.

7. **Remove dead basic blocks**: This technique eliminates basic blocks that do not affect the final result, simplifying the code and potentially allowing for further optimizations.

8. **Merge basic blocks**: This technique combines basic blocks that have a single predecessor, simplifying the code and potentially allowing for further optimizations.

9. **Constant folding**: This technique evaluates constant expressions at compile-time, reducing the number of computations needed at runtime.

10. **Dead code elimination**: This technique eliminates code that does not affect the final result, simplifying the code and potentially allowing for further optimizations.

11. **Common subexpression elimination**: This technique eliminates redundant computations by storing the result of a computation and reusing it when needed, rather than recomputing the same value multiple times.

## Practical 10

### Aim

Write a C program for selection sort and generate object code for three address code.

### Theory

Three-address code is a type of intermediate representation (IR) used in compilers, where each instruction has at most three operands and one operator.The exact procedure for converting three-address code into two-address or one-address code will depend on the specific IR and target architecture. However, here is a general outline of the procedure:

1. Create a flow graph from the three-address code.
2. Assign registers to each variable in the IR.
3. Convert three-address code to two-address code by eliminating one operand from each instruction.
4. Schedule instructions in each basic block to ensure efficient execution.

These steps can be automated using various compiler optimization techniques, such as global register allocation and instruction scheduling.
